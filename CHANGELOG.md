# OpenSD Documentation changelog

## 2024/04/08
### Added
 - Updated Antora theme with new codeberg repo URLs
 - Added [Touchpads] section in user's manual
 - Brought up-to-date with changes in OpenSD v0.51

### Changed
  - Changed project owner / maintainer
  - Moved project from gitlab to codeberg due to cloudflare sucking

  - Cleaned up man page a bit
  - Cleaned up scripts a little
  - Updated readme

### Removed
  - Removed unused opensd-files.5 manpage

### Notes
  - There were a few undesired artefacts with a full git migration, so we did an ugly one.
  - Dates and git histories have been reset.
  - Still more to clean up, but this should be good enough for the moment.
  - There's a been a kernel driver for a while now (that Valve did NOT write or provide documentation for, but PAID to take credit for), so I doubt anyone actually cares.
