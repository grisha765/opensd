### Notes
  - There were a few undesired artefacts with a full git migration, so we did an ugly one.
  - Dates and git histories have been reset.
  - Still more to clean up, but this should be good enough for the moment.
  - There's a been a kernel driver for a while now (that Valve did NOT write or provide documentation for, but PAID to take credit for), so I doubt anyone actually cares.
