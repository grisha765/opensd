= Cooling

The Steam Deck uses a single low-profile blower fan to cool the entire unit.  It's placed adjacent to the motherboard and connected to the APU via a copper heatpipe.

There's also an internal magnesium frame which functions as a heat spreader in addition to providing rigidity.

I've seen two different mfgs here, probably due to parts shortages.  From what little I've seen, the Huaying is noticibly quieter at higher speeds.
