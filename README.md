## About
OpenSD is a highly-configurable userspace driver for the Steam Deck written in modern C++.

It aims to be lighweight, very fast and provide a way to fully utilize the hardware without running any closed-source, proprietary or anti-privacy software like Steam.

If youâ€™re like me, you want to tinker with your hardware devices and build neat projects on them without needing to run any bloat.  As someone who builds and designs a lot of embedded systems, uses minimal Linux desktop envoronments and believes in Unix Philosophy: keeping things open, fast and small is paramount.

At the time of writing, there is no way to utilize the gamepad portion (buttons, thumbsticks, gyros, etc.) of the Steam Deck without also having to run Steam, since Steam implements an unpublished, undocumented, closed-source userspace driver to make it all work.  This means signing into an online service to access basic hardware functionality on a device that you own.  

While Valve makes broad gestures toward Linux, they are quite antithetical to the meaning and purpose of GNU, the GPL and Linux.

Valve keeps all of their own software, including hardware drivers and documentation, completely closed, which means devices like the Steam Deck, Steam Controller, Steam Link, VR hardware, etc. have no "official" Linux or *BSD drivers.  Valve also *refuses* to release any documentation for the hardware, which leaves FOSS developers stuck writing support in the most difficult way possible -- through guesswork and time-consuming reverse engineering.  Valve continues to refuse to cooperate with myself and others to develop FOSS drivers to support this hardware, while Sony, which *is not at all a paragon* of Linux or open-source, have voluntarily produced high quality in-tree drivers like **hid-playstation**.

Valve's Steam client is also closed source, but relies on the work of open-source programmers to even exist.  Valve purposefully hides their drivers inside the code of their client to force you to use and sign in to their online service to access your own hardware.  

SteamOS is consistantly the worst "distro" I've ever seen as it injects closed-source spyware, DRM and anti-security as an inseperable linchpin of its function.  It violates the principals on which GNU/Linux is built.  SteamOS 3.x also fails to implement basic package management and conflicts with their own update services.  SteamOS is *currently* (and has been for years) in violation of the GPL and does not even publish their sources.  Outside projects like [evlaV](https://gitlab.com/evlaV/jupiter-PKGBUILD) have been putting in heaps of effort to publish the sources which are REQUIRED to be made public on [Valve's private git instance](https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/), and, at present 30%-40% of these source packages are still unaccounted for.  It is my strong opinion that *no one* should use SteamOS and you should install your preferred distro instead.

Valve also does *not* respect privacy, which is a universal human right.  Valve does not restrict virtually any manner of abuse of made by the software they distribute on their platform, either.  Many titles published on Steam contain ring-zero (kernel-mode) rootkits which phone home to DRM servers and *directly inject code* into your machine over network connections.  This alone is a serious crime of computer ethics and Valve does not care, nor are they willing to explain or warn users of the obscene security and privacy holes they directly profit from.


This goal of this software is to provide a better, fully open-source implementation; ultimately unlocking the hardware to be used freely and unencumbered any by proprietary requirements.

## Features
Development is still ongoing, so several of the features are still incomplete.

- [x]   Small, fast, multi-threaded driver daemon.
- [x]   Fully configurable and mappable.
- [x]   Universal bindings system.
- [x]   Customizable gamepad profiles.
- [x]   Configurable by ini file.
- [ ]   GUI configuration tool.
- [ ]   CLI scripting tool.
- [x]   Fully configurable gamepad input (buttons, axes, etc.)
- [x]   Highly configurable trackpad support.
- [x]   Fully configurable mouse emulation.
- [ ]   Fully configurable motion controls.
- [x]   Configurable radial deadzones.
- [ ]   Full support for Force-Feedback / haptics.
- [ ]   Automatic and manual backlight control.
- [ ]   Battery reporting
- [x]   Install script
- [x]   Online documentation / Wiki
- [x]   Offline documentation
- [X]   manpage

## Current State
The current state is very usable.  Most of the main functionality of the driver is implemented and working reliably; more features will be added in time.  The GUI configuration tool does not exist yet, so all configuration is done with **ini** files (if you're like me you prefer that anyway, haha).

<br>

## Requirements
The code itself has very few dependencies other than the kernel.
- Kernel 4.9+
- GCC 8.0+ (for c++20 designated initializers)
- cmake 3.10+

Some of the hardware support for the Steam Deck is still pretty recent, so using the most recent kernel is highly recommended.

## Getting started
Check out the Getting Started section in the [online documentation]() for steps on getting, building, installing.

A current git build of OpenSD is also available in the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opensd-git).

<br>

## Using and configuring OpenSD
A beautiful online [user's manual]() can also be found in the online documentation.

Offline documentation is also available in the *doc* directory of this repository.  If you've already installed OpenSD, documentation can be found in `/usr/local/share/doc/opensd/` as well as man pages: **opensdd(1)** and **opensd-files(5)**

## Roadmap
The next big steps are getting a good understanding of the haptic reports the Steam Deck uses and getting IPC working so clients can connect to the daemon.

This is *roughly* the roadmap I'm currently looking at:
- IPC
- CLI scripting tool
- Force Feedback / haptics
- Backlight control
- GUI configuration tool

## Steam Deck hardware documentation
I've published a group of [hardware notes]() over in the user documentation site which may be of interest to some of you.

<br>

## Contributing
There are still a lot of open questions about the Steam Deck HID reports, particularly feature reports.  Most of the the work has come from reverse engineering input reports and function documenetation from the kernel Steam Controller driver.  Anyone who can fill in blanks in the code would be appreciated, just open an issue or submit a PR.

The user documentation also has its own repo at :::TODO::: if you'd like to help with that.  Please open an issue or submit a PR there for anything documentation related.

As always, feel free to buy me a coffee if you appreciate my work ;)
